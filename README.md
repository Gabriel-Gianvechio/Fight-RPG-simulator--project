# Fight-RPG-simulator--project

welcome to a simple project that I used to train javascript!

follow this steps:

- Create a Base Folder for project (for example: rpg-fight-project )
- drop .HTML here
- create folder assets (rpg-fight-project/assets)
- in ASSETS, drop .CSS 
- in ASSETS, create folder JS (rpg-fight-project/assets/js)
- in JS, drop functions.js and script.js

Run .HTML!

enjoy!
